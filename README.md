## Getting started

1. Compile

```bash
g++ ./main.cpp -o scheduler -Werror --std=c++11
```

2. Run

```bash
./scheduler.exe -i input_path -o output_path
```

Discard the options to use the standard i/o by default

## Getting started with CMake

CMake is a cross-platform compile method build system generator. Instead of using Visual Studio, CMake is an industry standard software--great with C++! You don't need to download some random compiler like Visual Studio which doesn't work with Linux, but instead you can just use terminal :D (Bonus: What companies use CMake? Some of the companies that use CMake include LÃ¶wenstein Medical, AVISTO, AMD, Shield AI, Applied Research Associates, Inc, Kitware, Autodesk, Raytheon, Medtronic, KeyLogic Systems and many more.)

1. Install CMake

2. Go into the build directory (or make one if you don't have one)
```bash
mkdir build
cd build
```

3. Generate build files & Compile

```
cmake ..
make -j
```

Now you have compiled and generated the build files!

4. Call the executable (aka main.cpp)

Make sure you're in the build directory

```bash
./target -input ../input -output ../output
```
